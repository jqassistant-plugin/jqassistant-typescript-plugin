# Testing Strategy
-> currently the LCE and jQA Plugin are tested separately via suites of integration tests

**LCE Integration Tests:**
- located under `./typescript/test`
- they test the extraction of individual [[Concepts|concepts]] by running the complete extraction process on different sample projects and validating the resulting `LCEConcept` objects
- to simply the test code a number of utility methods are defined under `./typescript/test/utils`

**jQA Plugin Integration Tests:**
- located under `./java/src/test`
- they test the generation of graph structures based on sample JSON reports generated by the LCE
- for changes in the report data structures the sample reports have to be re-generated by running `./java/src/test/resources/regenerate-test-data.sh`
